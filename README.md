## Getting Started

### Copying the template repository

You'll need to copy this repository to your Github username and enable a few settings.

1. Navigate to the [tech-portfolio](https://github.com/joatmon08/tech-portfolio) in your web browser.

1. Fork this repo to your GitHub user.
   ![fork](assets/fork.png)
   This repo contains all of the necessary files to deploy your technical portfolio; however, you need to configure this repository with the necessary settings to make it a GitHub Pages site.
   
   > :bangbang: Ensure you are on your forked repository by checking the upper left title of the repo. It should contain your GitHub user name.

1. Navigate to Settings in your forked repo.
   ![Settings](assets/settings.png)

1. On the Settings page, navigate to "Options" and scroll to the bottom to the "GitHub Pages" section.

1. Change the Source branch to "gh-pages" and keep the "/(root)" path and save this change. This contains the GitHub Actions workflow.
   ![GitHubPages](assets/ghpages.png)

1. Go to the Actions page of the repostiory.
   ![Actions Repo Page](assets/enableactions.png)

1. This original repo has a workflow file already configured and GitHub disables these when you fork them by default. To enable this pre-configured workflow, select the "I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them."

   > :bangbang: The Actions workflow will not do anything until you make additional changes.

Now you are ready to move into the repo and make this portfolio your own!

### Edit your portfolio with your personal info

1. Navigate to the Code page of your repo and make sure you are on the `main` branch. Click on the "website" folder and open the `siteConfig.js` file.
   ![Code](assets/path.png)

1. Click on the pencil icon to edit this file.
   ![siteConfig.js](assets/siteconfig.png)

There are four text fields and three social media links for you to update.

#### Update with your name and tagline

1. Find the `title:` field and add your name. Remember to keep this field in single quotes.
   ```js
   ...
   title: 'YOUR NAME',
   ```

1. The next line is `tagline:`. This field appears on your portfolio front page. Replace the placeholder with a description of you in three adjectives and the type of work you do or are looking for. Keep this field in single quotes as well. While we didn't put a character limit, keep it to 140 characters or less!
  ```js
   ...
   tagline: 'Technologist, awesome, and amazing.',
  ```

#### Update your site URL and organization

1. The next line is `url` and should be your GitHub username.
    ```js
    ...
    url: 'https://YOUR-GITHUB-USER.github.io',
    ```

1. Keep the `baseUrl` and `projectName` fields the same.
   > :bangbang: We are using a project GitHub page, not a global one associated with your username. If you do want your portfolio to be located at `your-user.github.io`, you must change the name of the repository.

1. Your `organizationName` is your GitHub username.
   ```js
   ...
   organizationName: 'YOUR-GITHUB-USER',
   ```

### Commit your changes

1. Once you have updated all of the above fields, you are ready to commit these initial changes.
1. Click the "Commit changes" button to save your changes.

### Review the Actions workflow

To observe GitHub Actions building your page, go the "Actions" section of the repo.

![workflowrunning](assets/build1.png)

Click on the "Update siteConfig.js" job. GitHub displays the actions it is taking to build & publish your portfolio.

![buildrunning](assets/build2.png)

When the "build" job is complete, navigate to your portfolio in another tab of your web browser.

Your URL is "https://YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME.github.io/tech-portfolio/" and this site displays your live portfolio.

Congratulations! You completed this walkthrough and have a live technical portfolio! Any changes in your forked repo will trigger a new build and will update your site.

## Update Your Profile Picture

Follow these instructions to update your profile picture on the
home page.

1. Save the photo you want to use for your profile and name the photo `profile.png`.

1. Navigate to the `website/static/img` folder of your technical portfolio.

1. Click the Add file drop-down and choose "Upload files".
   ![website/static/img](assets/profileadd.png)

1. Choose your file called `profile.png` and commit this as a change to your repository.

1. Check your live website. The home page should have your photo.


## Update Your Social Media Links

1. Scroll to the bottom of the `website/siteConfig.js` file in the editor.

1. Check out the `socialMedia` section. This section controls the social media icons and links at the bottom of your portfolio!
   ```js
    socialMedia: {
        linkedin: 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/',
        twitter: 'https://twitter.com/',
        github: 'https://github.com/',
        //facebook: 'https://www.facebook.com/',
        //instagram: 'https://www.instagram.com/',
        //youtube: 'https://www.youtube.com/',
        //twitch: 'https://www.twitch.tv/'
    },
   ```
   ![docs/assets](assets/socialmedia.png)

1. Navigate to your social media profile page. Copy the URL and paste it into the field.
   1. For example, find your LinkedIn public profile name, login to your LinkedIn account and view your profile.
   1. On your profile page, click "Edit public profile & URL" from the upper right section of the page.
      ![profile](assets/linkedin.png)
   1. Under "Edit your custom URL", copy the entire URL (`https://www.linkedin.com/in/yourprofile`). This is your LinkedIn profile URL.
   1. Paste it in your `linkedin:` setting.
      ```js
      linkedin: 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/yourprofile',
      ```

1. If you want to add social media, check out the commented lines (lines starting with `//`). You can enable the social
   media icons by delete the `//` from the line.
    ```js
    linkedin: 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/yourprofile', <- delete the // at the beginning of the line to use
    ```

1. If you don't have a social media profile for the specific website, you can add the `//` to the beginning of the line. These will be ignored.
    ```js
    // linkedin: 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/yourprofile', <- added the // at the beginning of the line to ignore
    ```

1. The page will update with the social media icons automatically!

If our list doesn't include a social media icon you want, feel free to open a Github issue and tell us which one you're
looking for!

## Add a Blog

Usually, it is easier to use a blogging platform to write a blog. However, we added this
into your tech portfolio if you want to manage your blogs yourself. To add a new post...

1. In the `website` directory of the repo, find the `blog` folder.

1. Create a new file called `<YEAR>-<MM>-<DD>-blog-post.md`. Make sure you name it
   with the year, month, and date. If your month or day is single digits, make sure you add
   the `0` in front of it (e.g., February is `02`). Keep the `-blog-post.md`.

1. Copy the contents of `2020-10-03-blog-template.md`. Paste into your new blog post.

1. Change the title to one that you want to name your post.

1. Update the body of the post with some content.

1. Commit your changes and navigate to Actions, where the new build job will run and add your new blog post.

1. To see this page, navigate to your site and click the `Blogs` page.
   ![show blogs](assets/blog.png)

## Delete Your Portfolio
