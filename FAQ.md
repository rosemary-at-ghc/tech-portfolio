# Frequently Asked Questions

* **Why aren't my changes showing up on my live website?** We use a two step process to update the page.
  Sometimes, you have to wait about 5 minutes before the changes show up on your live website.

* **Do I need to manually click "build" to build my page?** No, you do not. Any time you make a "commit",
  Github Actions will automatically know to build it for you.

* **I don't see any builds running in Github Actions.** This often happens because you committed a change
  before enabling GitHub Actions. Make sure you enable Github Actions first, then commit another change.

* **How do I add my Facebook, Instagram, or Twitch username to the icons at the bottom?** See [Update Your Social Media Links](./README.md#update-your-social-media-links).

* **What if I don't see a social media profile listed and I want to add it?** Feel free to open a GitHub issue and let us know!

* **How do I change the picture on the home page?** See [Update Your Profile Picture](./README.md#update-your-profile-picture).

* **I did this workshop before and I want to use the new stuff you updated on this one. How do I do that?** See [Apply Updates from This Template Repository to Your Portfolio](#apply-updates-from-this-template-repository-to-your-portfolio).
